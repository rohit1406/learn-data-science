## Description
This part is based on lifecycle of data science. Here we will demonstrates how a data scienties should approach a problem statement to derive meaningful data out of the raw data.

### 1. Data Capturing
This phase focuses on aquiring the data and defining the purpose and problem that need to be addressed. This is well demonstrated in [this assignment](./data-capture-assignment.md). 

### 2. Data Analysis
**Data profiling** can summarize and gather some general overall information about our dataset through techniques of **descriptive statistics**. The functions such as describe(), sample(), query() are used for sampling and querying desired data. This is demonstrated in [this program](./taxi-data-analysis.py).
