## Description
This repository is created for Data Science concepts implementation.
Below is the list of programs implemented during this learning.

## Dependencies 
### Software Dependencies
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum)  
2. [SQLite Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite&WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum) 
3. [Cosmos Db Emulator](https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-emulator)  

### Internal Project Dependencies
1. requests - to make HTTP calls
2. html.parser
3. os - for dealing with file handling

### External Project Dependencies (pip install ***)
1. nlp_rake - for keyword extraction
2. matplotlib - data visualization and plotting graphs  
3. wordcloud - another better way to visualize word frequencies
4. numpy - is a library for working with tensors, i.e. multi-dimensional arrays
5. pandas - allows you to manipulate so-called Dataframes, which are analogous to relational tables 
6. SciPy - a library with additional scientific functions
7. Plotly - a plotting library
8. scikit-learn - for predictive data analysis
9. seaborn - Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is a library to visualize relationships between variables. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.  
10. PyWaffle - to draw a 'waffle' type chart which is a different way to visualize quantities as a 2D array of squares.
