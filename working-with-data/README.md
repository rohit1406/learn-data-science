## Description
Couple of programs related to Data Science & **Working with Data** topic.

## List of Programs
### 1. Working with Series and DataFrames   
[This program](./working_with_data_test.py) demonstrates the usage working with Series and DataFrames. It uses numpy and pandas library to perform some calculations on the Series of data and matplotlib to plot the graph from the data.


### 2. Modelling of epidemic spread of COVID-19
This is a demonstration of **Structured Data Analysis**. The program aims to load the epidemic spread of COVID19 data from internet or local disc. The data is of number of **infected people, recovered and dead people** across the globe and present in **csv file**. There is also data related to countries like population. Once data is loaded, it **analyzes** the whole data **per country** to  
- find number of infected people 
- new infected people average
- percentage of infected people with respect to population
Once this   
[Python Program](./modelling_covid19_spread.py)


### 3. Analyzing COVID-19 Papers  
[This is](./covid19_papers.py) an example of **Unstructured Data Processing** wherein we are analyzing COVID-19 papers for the trends and analysis.  

Note that the data for analysis is not provided with this repo. The size of the file is 1.4GB and can be downloaded from [here](https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/historical_releases/cord-19_2020-04-10.tar.gz).
